# Timezone Information Script

This script allows users to input a timezone and retrieves the current time in that timezone. It also suggests similar timezones if the provided one is not found. It is accepted that a DB is not the best way of storing this data but I want to use this technology here to demonstrate my capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLite

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vickerys79/timezone-information-script.git
    cd timezone-information-script
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python timezone_script.py
